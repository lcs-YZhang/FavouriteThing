Rising from humble origins to become the Hand of Noxus, he cleaves through the empire's enemies‚Äîmany of them Noxians themselves.

                          Within the empire, anyone could rise to power, no matter their birth, culture, or background, and none embraced this ideal more fervently than Darius. From humble beginnings, he rose steadily through the ranks, always putting duty before all else, and garnering great respect for his aggression, discipline, and refusal to ever take a backward step. On the bloodsoaked fields of Dalamor Plain, he even beheaded a Noxian general after the coward ordered a retreat. Roaring in defiance and hefting his bloodied axe overhead, Darius rallied the scattered warbands and won a great and unexpected victory against a far more numerous foe.

                          He was rewarded with a senior command of his own, attracting many thousands of eager recruits from across the empire. Darius turned the majority away, accepting only the strongest, the most disciplined and iron-willed. Such was his fearsome notoriety, even in the lands beyond Noxus, that it was not uncommon for entire cities to surrender at the first sight of his banners.

                          The Dunk was first released in 1985, the same year as the similar Air Jordan 1, as a hightop basketball sneaker. It's initial campaign focused on color treatments for college basketball powerhouses under the banner "Be True to Your School." But by the '90s, the sneaker was adopted by skaters because, also like the Air Jordan 1, it offered top-notch cushioning, support, and traction.
                          
                          This relationship would become even more solidified in 2001, when Sandy Bodecker took over Nike SB and redesigned the Dunk to cater to skaters specifically. Even more cushioning was added to support the impact of skateboarding, and the tread was tailored for better traction in grip tape as opposed to its origins on the hardwood. The most meaningful, and visible, change, however, came in the fat tongue ‚Äî a common sight in skateboarding shoes of the era.
